description: Interactive skill for discussing and designing the next phase of a Rust project. Facilitates a conversation with the user about goals, scope, and high-level design, producing a markdown plan document as output. Use when the user says "/next-phase-plan", "plan the next phase", "what should the next phase do", "let's figure out the next steps", or wants to decide what the next phase should accomplish before breaking it into tasks. This is the FIRST step in the planning pipeline — its output feeds into /plan-review and then /enrich-phase-plan.

# Next Phase Plan

Facilitates a structured discussion to define the next phase of work. Produces a high-level plan document — not a TOML task breakdown. The plan document then goes through `/plan-review` (architectural gate) and `/enrich-phase-plan` (TOML elaboration) before implementation.

## Trigger

`/next-phase-plan`

No arguments. This skill is conversational — it gathers context and discusses with the user.

## Command-line Tools

- use `fd` instead of `find`
- use `rg` instead of `grep`

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Context

Automatically collect background before engaging the user:

1. **Project memory**:

   ```bash
   MEMORY_DIR="$HOME/.claude/projects/$(pwd | sd '/' '-')/memory"
   ```

   Read `$MEMORY_DIR/MEMORY.md` and every linked memory file.

2. **Recent git history** (last 10 commits on `main`):

   ```bash
   git log --oneline -10 main
   ```

3. **Existing plan files** (if any):

   ```bash
   fd -e md -e toml . plans/
   ```

   Read the most recent plan file to understand what was last planned.

4. **Deferred improvements** from prior review rounds:

   ```bash
   fd deferred.md notes/pr-reviews/
   ```

   Read all `deferred.md` files found — these are improvements the reviewer identified but the plan didn't commission, and they are candidates for this phase.

5. **Execution reports** (if any):

   ```bash
   fd -e md . execution_reports/
   ```

   Skim the most recent report to understand what was completed and what failed.

### Step 2: Propose Phase Goals

Invoke the `rust-development-pipeline:rust-architect` agent to synthesize the context and propose a set of goals for the next phase:

```
You are helping define the next phase of a Rust project.

<project_memory>
{{MEMORY_CONTENTS}}
</project_memory>

<recent_git_history>
{{GIT_LOG}}
</recent_git_history>

<last_plan>
{{LAST_PLAN_CONTENTS — or "No prior plan found"}}
</last_plan>

<deferred_improvements>
{{DEFERRED_CONTENTS — or "None"}}
</deferred_improvements>

<execution_report>
{{LAST_REPORT_SUMMARY — or "No prior execution report"}}
</execution_report>

Propose candidate goals for the NEXT phase. For each goal:
- State what it achieves and why it's the right next step
- Estimate whether it is a small, medium, or large effort
- Note any dependencies on prior work or on other goals in this list

Also flag any deferred improvements that are now appropriate to incorporate.

Keep the list focused — 3 to 7 goals is ideal. Do not decompose into tasks.
```

Present the architect's proposal to the user.

### Step 3: Iterate with the User

Discuss the proposed goals with the user. Typical questions to work through:

- Which goals are in scope for this phase vs. a later phase?
- Are there goals missing from the proposal?
- Are any deferred improvements now ready to absorb?
- What are the hard constraints (API stability, performance, deadline)?
- What should explicitly be **out of scope** for this phase?

Use the `rust-development-pipeline:rust-architect` agent for follow-up analysis as needed (e.g., if the user wants to explore a specific design direction).

There is no fixed number of rounds — continue until the user is satisfied with the scope.

### Step 4: Write the Plan Document

Once the scope is agreed, produce a structured markdown plan document and save it to the path the user specifies (default: `plans/phase-{N}/PHASE_PLAN.md`):

```markdown
# Phase {N}: {Phase Name}

**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Status:** Draft

## Goals

{Numbered list of agreed goals, each with a one-paragraph description of what it achieves and why now.}

## Scope Boundaries

**In scope:**
{Bulleted list of what this phase covers}

**Out of scope:**
{Bulleted list of what is explicitly deferred — prevents scope creep during implementation}

## Design Notes

{Key architectural decisions, constraints, and cautions raised during the discussion. This section is the input to the /plan-review gate.}

## Deferred Items Absorbed

{List any deferred improvements from prior phases that this plan incorporates, with a note on where/how they fit. If none, write "None."}

## Open Questions

{Unresolved questions that /plan-review or /enrich-phase-plan may need to address. If none, write "None."}
```

Commit the plan document:

```bash
git add plans/phase-{N}/PHASE_PLAN.md
git commit -m "plan(phase-{N}): initial phase plan — {Phase Name}"
```

### Step 5: Handoff

Tell the user:

> "Phase {N} plan saved to `plans/phase-{N}/PHASE_PLAN.md`.
>
> Next steps:
> 1. `/plan-review plans/phase-{N}/PHASE_PLAN.md` — architectural gate; decides on any deferred items and catches design gaps before implementation.
> 2. `/elaborate-directions plans/phase-{N}/PHASE_PLAN.md` — decomposes the plan into structured directions.json with task groups, wiring checklists, and descriptive guidance.
> 3. `/explore-implement notes/directions/<phase-slug>/directions.json` — implements in a git worktree with real compiler feedback.
> 4. `/make-judgement <directions-path>` — validates the implementation against the directions and produces fixes if needed."

## Boundaries

**Will:**
- Discuss scope, goals, and design decisions with the user before any tasks are written
- Surface deferred improvements as explicit candidates
- Produce a structured plan document with clear scope boundaries

**Will not:**
- Decompose into TOML tasks (that is `/enrich-phase-plan`'s job)
- Review the plan for architectural soundness (that is `/plan-review`'s job)
- Make implementation decisions without user input
